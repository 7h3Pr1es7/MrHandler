# 🌐 MR.HANDLER 🌐
MR.Handler is a specialized tool designed for responding to security incidents on Linux systems.
It connects to target systems via SSH to execute a range of diagnostic commands, gathering crucial information such as network configurations, system logs, user accounts, and running processes.
At the end of its operation, the tool compiles all the gathered data into a comprehensive HTML report. 
This report details both the specifics of the incident response process and the current state of the system, enabling security analysts to more effectively assess and respond to incidents.
